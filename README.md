# Python-Project
It consists of an .exe file named 'Samantha' which is a voice enabled PDA (personal desktop assistant).
You'll find a python file(main.py) as well which consists the code with appropriate and helpful comments. Later i coverted this python file into an desktop application(.exe) to make it run even smooother.
Despcription:- Samantha is capable of doing daily tasks on your voice commands. For ex: controlling brightness, playing music, opeining website/application and much more. And the best part? I integrated Samantha with OpenAI and now it is capable of answering question based on AI knowledge. I would recommend to run Samantha and explore its features and boundaries.
Lastly, It's just a prototype I created for my personal use and in coming future i would definitely take it further !!
